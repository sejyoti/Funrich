# Funrich
Funrichment analysis of autophagy genes


"FunRich" (Functional Enrichment analysis tool) is a bioinformatics software tool used to perform functional enrichment analysis on large datasets of genes or proteins. It is specifically designed to analyze omics data, such as transcriptomic or proteomic data, and help researchers identify enriched biological pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, and protein domains.

FunRich utilizes multiple databases and algorithms to generate a comprehensive and reliable analysis of the input dataset. It can perform a variety of enrichment analyses, including over-representation analysis (ORA), gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and pathway topology analysis (PTA). The software also provides interactive visualization tools, allowing users to explore the results and generate publication-quality graphics.

Overall, FunRich is a powerful and user-friendly tool that can help researchers gain insights into the biological processes and pathways associated with their datasets, aiding in the interpretation of complex omics data.
